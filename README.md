# MobileAppDevelopment

<h1>ToDo List</h1>
This is my project for Mobile Application Development 2.<br>
In the project, I have developed a ToDo List in Xamarin forms.<br>
Once the user runs the App, the user will be faced with the UI. In the UI, the user will be shown the data that is preloaded in the JSON file, an entry box, where the user can input new tasks to complete, and a Create New Task and delete button.<br>
If the user adds a task to the entry box, they will be able to click the the Create New Task button, where the task will be pushed to the JSON, and will be displayed at the bottom of the task list. When the button is clicked, the entry box will also clear from the data the user inputted.<br>
If the user clicks the "Delete List" button,the entire JSON list will be deleted when the user next enters the app.<br>
When the user creates a task, the status of the task is set to "Incomplete", when the user clicks the "Update" button, the status will change to "Complete"
The user will be able to delete a specific task by clicking te "Delete" button on the left hand side of the selected task.
